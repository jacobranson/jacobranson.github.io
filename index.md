My name is Jake. I'm a 21 year old senior in Drexel University's Computer Science Class of 2021. Alongside my B.S. in Computer Science, I have a concentration in Game Programming and Development. I currently work for Randstad USA at Vanguard as a full-stack web development intern. I have previously worked for ASRC Federal Mission Solutions as a developer intern on the Aegis Defence System, as well. One of my goals is to release an indie game in the next few years.
