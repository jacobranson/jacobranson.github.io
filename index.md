My name is Jake. I'm a senior in Drexel University's Computer Science Class of 2021. Alongside my B.S. in Computer Science, I have a concentration in Game Programming and Development. I currently work for Randstad USA at Vanguard as a full-stack web development intern. I have previously worked for ASRC Federal Mission Solutions as a developer intern on the Aegis Defence System, as well. One of my goals is to release an indie game in the next few years.

## Skills

* [Java Development with Spring Framework](experience/java)

## Interests

I am an avid Linux user. Currently I run elementary OS on my laptop and Pop!\_OS on my desktop. I also enjoy playing video games on my Switch, PS4, and PC. I play board games frequently as well. Some of my favorite games right now are Hearthstone and Catan. If you would like some further reading into my thoughts and experiences, check out my [blog](blog).
