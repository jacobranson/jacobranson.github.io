### Hey!

My name is Jake. I am a senior in Drexel University's Computer Science Class of 2021. Alongside my B.S. in Computer Science, I have a concentration in Game Programming and Development. I currently work for Randstad USA at Vanguard as a full-stack web development intern. I have previously worked for ASRC Federal Mission Solutions Engineering on the Aegis Defence System as an intern, as well. One of my goals is to release an indie game in the next few years.
